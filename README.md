# Oliver Wilson's Portfolio

This is a project that I've created for two reasons:

- **0.** To showcase my skills as a software engineer.
- **1.** To have some fun experimenting with different technologies.

I reference my experiences that I have gained through working on some interesting projects during my career and I also detail some of my interests outside of web development.

You can visit the site here: **https://www.oliverwilson.dev/**.

The application is an express server, hosted in the cloud that responds to routes and then handles them routes via react router. The choice for using an express server to respond to requests and serve a client-side rendered application is to afford flexibility to move towards server-side rendering in the future.

## Hosting
