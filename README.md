# Oliver Wilson Portfolio

This is a simple static react page deployed via Github pages.

## TODO
[] Use circle CI to build the app on each commit to the `master` branch and push the generated files with an automated commit message e.g. `RELEASE: #1234`

[] Use `react-router` to handle invalid routes. E.g. will need some 404 page component that offers to redirect the user to the main site.

[] Have more use cases for redux. What other cool features could be implemented? Maybe an email form? Seems cheesy.
