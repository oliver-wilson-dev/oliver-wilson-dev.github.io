# Oliver Wilson Portfolio

This is a simple static react page deployed via Github pages.

You can visit the site [here](https://www.oliverwilson.dev/).

## Hosting
This page is hosted via Github pages with the employment of Cloudflare and Google domains.

Github pages provides a way of hosting static files to the client, with no server side code options available at the time of development. The domain was purchased from Google Domains and uses Cloudflare as a middle-man to provide SSL and caching.

A detailed guide on how the website is hosted can be found [here](https://www.randydeng.com/website/2019/07/08/using-github-pages-with-google-domains-and-cloudflare.html)

In the future, I hope to introduce additional pages to the website. This is currently implemented using react-router-dom's HashRouter, which I am not a fan of. The goal will be to host this website on a server and use express to service requests to the application on various routes.
